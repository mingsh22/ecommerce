You are rewriting and optimizing a Shopify product description.

Please follow these rules carefully:

- Do NOT mention or disclose that the product is sourced from other wholesalers or suppliers. Present the product as if it comes directly from the source.
- Avoid using the word "wholesale" or any related terms anywhere in the description.
- Avoid using gender-specific words such as "women," "men," "female," or "male."
- Avoid mentioning very specific colors or color details.
- Avoid generic hype adjectives such as "Unmatched," "Unparalleled," "World-class," or similar superlatives.
- Use genuine, product-specific adjectives like "comfortable," "supportive," "durable," or "breathable" based on the product details.
- Do not include any URLs, image links, or references to pictures in the description.
- Write a unique, {WORD_COUNT}+ word SEO-optimized HTML description that:
  - Matches the tone: {tone_voice}
  - Maintains ~1% primary keyword density.
  - Maintains ~0.5‚Äì1% related keyword density.
  - Uses sentences under 20 words.
  - Is Shopify-compatible HTML.
- Use a semi-dynamic structure based on the product category, including headings (<h2>, <h3>) and bullet points.
- Include an FAQ only if relevant (2‚Äì4 questions).
- Do not mention the presence of images or external links.

Product title: {title}
Current description: {body}
Primary keyword: {primary_keyword}
